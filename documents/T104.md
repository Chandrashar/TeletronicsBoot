Terraform includes the concept of provisioners as a measure of pragmatism, knowing that there will always be certain behaviors that can't be directly represented in Terraform's declarative model.

However, they also add a considerable amount of complexity and uncertainty to Terraform usage. Firstly, Terraform cannot model the actions of provisioners as part of a plan because they can in principle take any action. Secondly, successful use of provisioners requires coordinating many more details than Terraform usage usually requires: direct network access to your servers, issuing Terraform credentials to log in, making sure that all of the necessary external software is installed, etc.

The following sections describe some situations which can be solved with provisioners in principle, but where better solutions are also available. We do not recommend using provisioners for any of the use-cases described in the following sections.

Even if your specific use-case is not described in the following sections, we still recommend attempting to solve it using other techniques first, and use provisioners only if there is no other option.
