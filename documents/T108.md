we decided to monitor the metrics of legacy Spring applications we were running on our production systems. While searching around, I realized that a nice way to not reinvent the wheel was to integrate my app with the Spring Boot Actuator. By using the actuator, we have many tools like Grafana and Prometheus for easily monitoring our applications. However, in order to integrate such a legacy Spring application with the Spring Boot Actuator, you need to make it Spring-Boot-ready first.
